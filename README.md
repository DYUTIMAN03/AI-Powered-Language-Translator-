## <span style="color: #2196F3;">Getting Started</span>

To get started with this project, you need to set up the environment. The project uses Python and virtual environments to manage dependencies. Here's how you can set up the project and the environment on your local machine:

### <span style="color: #FF5722;">1. Clone the Repository</span>
git clone https://github.com/Adiitya2328/Generative-A-I-Language-Translator.git
cd Generative-A-I-Language-Translator
### <span style="color: #FF5722;">2. Set Up the Virtual Environment</span>
Note: The .venv folder, which contains the virtual environment and all project dependencies, has been excluded from version control via .gitignore to avoid uploading large files to GitHub.

Instead, the list of required dependencies is stored in the requirements.txt file.

Steps to recreate the virtual environment:
Create the virtual environment:

Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:
python -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
      .\.venv\Scripts\activate

### <span style="color: #FF5722;">3. Install the Required Dependencies</span>
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
